                            <br>
                            Using Creative Commons Public Licenses<br>
                            <br>
                            Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
                            conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
                            original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
                            and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
                            following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
                            exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.<br>
                            <br>
                            Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                            intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                            permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                            copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                            irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                            and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                            Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                            applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                            material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                            material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                            licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                            limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
                            wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors<br>
                            <br>
                            Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                            licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                            licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                            the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                            example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                            copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                            licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                            other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                            the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                            reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                            rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                            such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                            Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                            respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

                            portion of the contents of the database;<br>
                            <br>
                            b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
                            contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                            Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                            Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br>
                            <br>
                            c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
                            all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br>
                            <br>
                            For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
                            replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
                            Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br>
                            <br>
                            a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
                            EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
                            AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
                            ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
                            IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                            WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                            PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
                            ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
                            KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
                            ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
                            <br>
                            b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
                            TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                            NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
                            INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
                            COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
                            USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
                            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
                            DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
                            IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
                            <br>
                            c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
                            above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
                            possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
                            waiver of all liability.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br>
                            <br>
                            a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
                            Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
                            this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
                            terminate automatically.<br>
                            <br>
                            b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
                            Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br>
                            <br>
                            1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                            violation; or<br>
                            <br>
                            2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br>
                            <br>
                            For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
                            right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
                            of this Public License.<br>
                            <br>
                            c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
                            Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
                            distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
                            will not terminate this Public License.<br>
                            <br>
                            d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
                            License.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br>
                            <br>
                            a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
                            terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br>
                            <br>
                            b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
                            Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
                            independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br>
                            <br>
                            a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
                            shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
                            conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
                            be made without permission under this Public License.<br>
                            <br>
                            b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
                            deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
                            minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
                            cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
                            without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
                            conditions.<br>
                            <br>
                            c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
                            failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
                            Licensor.<br>
                            <br>
                            d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
                            as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
                            that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
                            processes of any jurisdiction or authority.<br>
                            <br>
